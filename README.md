Unit Converter


This is a small project I built over the summer to get more comfortable with JavaScript. Itâ€™s a basic unit converter that handles length, volume, and mass conversions. 
I added a few extra features to make it more interactive, like a rewind button that lets you go back through your conversion history using localStorage,
a theme toggle button to switch between light and dark mode, and a reset button to clear everything. It was a fun way to practice DOM manipulation, 
event handling, and working with stored data.
